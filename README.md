# CampusAI - AI-Powered Virtual Receptionist

> An intelligent campus assistant platform for Centennial College students powered by AI and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Project Overview

CampusAI is a prototype AI application designed to help Centennial College students find information quickly through a conversational interface. The system uses official college information indexed in a vector database to provide accurate, sourced answers to common student questions.

**Course**: Software Engineering Fundamentals  
**Institution**: Centennial College  
**Project Lead**: Abrar Habib

## Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

- 💬 **AI Chat Interface** - Conversational Q&A with students

- 📚 **Source Citations** - Displays where information comes from
- 🎬 **Talking Avatar** - Visual avatar for responses
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech** - Audio output of responses
- 🏢 **Department Recommendations** - Suggests relevant departments

### Out of Scope (Not in Current Version)

- Student authentication or login

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+
- Git
- Ollama (for local LLM, optional during development)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/campusai.git
cd campusai
```

2. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

4. **Ollama Setup** (Optional - for local LLM)
```bash
# Download from https://ollama.ai
ollama pull mistral
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md).

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation.

### Key Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /health` - Status
- `POST /api/query` - Submit a query to the AI

See [API.md](docs/API.md) for complete documentation.
